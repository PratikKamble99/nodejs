# Issue with Reading Large Files in Node.js

When attempting to read a large file, Node.js loads the entire file data into memory(RAM) before sending response. This can lead to:

- **Memory Overflow Errors:** If the file size exceeds the available memory, your application may crash.
- **Performance Issues:** Loading the whole file at once can significantly degrade performance, especially with very large files.

**Solution:**  
To efficiently handle large files, consider using streams, which process data in smaller chunks rather than loading everything into memory at once.

# Streams:

    It reads the file into chunks and processes them one by one, allowing for efficient handling of large files.

    This approach prevents memory overflow errors and improves performance.

# PIP:

In Node.js, a pipe is a mechanism that connects a readable stream to a writable stream. This allows data to flow directly from the source to the destination without the need for manual processing.
